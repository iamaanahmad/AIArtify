You can delete all the hashtags, you donâ€™t need them. The tags for Metis and artify are enough.

Is it possibly actually to add the image to the post too? Not only link.

And after I share through twitter the app freezes for me. I have to reload it

If I choose to share via device I get the error. Like in the first image

And if I choose to share via QR code, it is not actually creating the QR code

The last image

2:54
And is it possible to add share function to the nfts in my gallery?
