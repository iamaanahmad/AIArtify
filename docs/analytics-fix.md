# Analytics Dashboard Fix

## Issue Description
The analytics dashboard was showing an error:
```
Error: Objects are not valid as a React child (found: object with keys {level, count, percentage}). If you meant to render a collection of children, use an array instead.
```

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `getDashboardData()` function in `src/lib/analytics.ts`. The function was returning complex objects and arrays that the React components couldn't properly render:

1. **qualityLevelUsage**: Was returning an array of objects with `{level, count, percentage}` structure
2. **qualityDistribution**: Was returning an array of objects with `{label, value, color}` structure  
3. **popularWords**: Was returning an array of objects with `{word, count}` structure
4. **popularStyles**: Was returning an array of objects with `{style, count}` structure

## Solution
Fixed the data structures to match what the React components expect:

### 1. Quality Level Usage
**Before:**
```typescript
qualityLevelUsage: [
  { level: "premium", count: 67, percentage: 45.6 },
  { level: "high", count: 47, percentage: 32.0 },
  { level: "standard", count: 33, percentage: 22.4 }
]
```

**After:**
```typescript
qualityLevelUsage: {
  premium: 67,
  high: 47,
  standard: 33
}
```

### 2. Quality Distribution
**Before:**
```typescript
qualityDistribution: [
  { label: "Premium", value: 45, color: "#8b5cf6" },
  { label: "High", value: 32, color: "#06b6d4" },
  { label: "Standard", value: 23, color: "#10b981" }
]
```

**After:**
```typescript
qualityDistribution: {
  premium: 45,
  high: 32,
  medium: 23,
  low: 12
}
```

### 3. Popular Words and Styles
**Before:**
```typescript
popularWords: [
  { word: "cyberpunk", count: 34 },
  { word: "fantasy", count: 28 }
]
```

**After:**
```typescript
popularWords: [
  ["cyberpunk", 34],
  ["fantasy", 28]
]
```

### 4. Time Ranges
Added fallback data for time ranges when no analytics data exists:
```typescript
timeRanges: {
  last24h: { count: 23, avgQuality: 0.84, avgProcessingTime: 3200, mintRate: 0.91 },
  last7d: { count: 89, avgQuality: 0.82, avgProcessingTime: 3400, mintRate: 0.89 },
  last30d: { count: 147, avgQuality: 0.85, avgProcessingTime: 3100, mintRate: 0.92 }
}
```

## Result
✅ Analytics dashboard now loads without errors
✅ All data structures properly render in React components
✅ Dashboard displays realistic demo data for hackathon presentation
✅ No compilation errors or React warnings

## Files Modified
- `src/lib/analytics.ts` - Fixed `getDashboardData()` function data structures

## Testing
- Development server runs successfully on port 9003
- Analytics dashboard loads without React errors
- All analytics tabs (Overview, Quality, Engagement, Insights) render correctly
