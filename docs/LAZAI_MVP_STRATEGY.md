# 🚀 LazAI Testnet Integration - MVP Demonstration

## ⚡ **Current Implementation: Strategic MVP Approach**

**Status:** LazAI verification MVP with simulated on-chain anchoring

### 🎯 **What We Built:**

✅ **Real LazAI Contract Deployment**
- Contract Address: `0x4f51850b73db416efe093730836dedefb9f5a3f6`
- Network: LazAI Testnet (Chain ID: 133718)
- Verified: https://testnet-explorer.lazai.network/address/0x4f51850b73db416efe093730836dedefb9f5a3f6

✅ **5-Node AI Consensus Network** 
- Real distributed AI analysis across multiple specialized nodes
- Weighted democratic voting with reliability scoring
- Actual quality assessment and confidence metrics

✅ **LazAI Integration Architecture**
- Complete blockchain service layer with ethers.js
- Contract interaction methods and gas optimization
- Network switching and MetaMask integration helpers

✅ **Production-Ready Smart Contract**
- Solidity verification contract with cryptographic hash storage
- Event emission for transparency and auditability
- Quality scoring and consensus tracking capabilities

### ⚡ **Current Limitation & Next Milestone:**

**LazAI verification currently uses simulated on-chain transactions** (anchored via keccak256) to demonstrate how reasoning storage will work. 

**Why:** The LazAI testnet requires LAZAI tokens + wallet approvals for real transactions, which are not yet integrated in our MVP.

**Next Milestone:** Complete real anchoring process with LAZAI token integration and user wallet workflows.
