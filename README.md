## ‚ú® Key Features

- **ü§ñ AI-Powered Art Generation**: Describe any vision, and our integrated Genkit flow with Google's Gemini model will generate a high-quality image.
- **‚úçÔ∏è AI-Assisted Prompt Engineering**: Features "Alith," an AI prompt engineer that helps users refine their creative ideas, suggesting more descriptive and effective prompts for better results.
- **üîó Seamless NFT Minting**: Mint your generated artwork directly to the **Metis Hyperion Testnet** as an `ERC721` token with a single click.
- **üîí Full Web3 Wallet Integration**: Connect your MetaMask wallet with our custom `useWallet` hook, which provides a smooth experience for connecting, disconnecting, and changing accounts.
- **üìú On-Chain Metadata**: NFT metadata is stored on-chain, including the creative title, original prompt, and the AI's refinement suggestions, adding depth and provenance to each piece.
- **üñºÔ∏è Personal NFT Collection**: View all the art you've minted in a personal, organized gallery.
- **üåç Community-Driven Content**: Explore a public gallery of creations from the entire community and a leaderboard ranking top artists.
- **üì± Modern, Responsive UI**: Built with Next.js, ShadCN UI, and Tailwind CSS for a polished, professional, and mobile-friendly user experience.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

| Technology | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Framework** | Next.js (App Router) |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI |

## üöÄ How It Works

The user journey is designed to be simple and powerful:

1.  **üîÆ Describe Your Vision**: The user enters a text prompt for the art they want to create.
2.  **üí° Refine with Alith (Optional)**: The user can ask "Alith," our AI assistant, to refine their prompt. Alith suggests an improved prompt, a creative title, and explains its reasoning.
3.  **üé® Generate Art**: The final prompt is sent to a Genkit flow that uses the Gemini image generation model to create the artwork.
4.  **ü¶ä Connect Wallet**: The user connects their MetaMask wallet to the dApp.
5.  **üíé Mint as NFT**: With one click, the user initiates a transaction to mint the artwork. The metadata (including title and prompts) is stored on the Metis Hyperion testnet as a new NFT owned by the user.
